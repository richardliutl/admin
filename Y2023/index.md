## Y2023 Puzzle

**Y2023**. How many integers from 1 to 100 can you form using the
digits 2, 0, 2, and 3 exactly once each, along with the operators
+, −, × (multiplication), ÷ (division), and exponentiation? We desire solutions containing
the minimum number of operators; among solutions having a
given number of operators, those using the digits in the order
2, 0, 2, 3 are preferred. Parentheses may be used; they do not
count as operators. A leading minus sign, however, does count
as an operator.
